Project Title:
EchoTrack Blog: A web app to track and display environmental statistics.

Description:
This web application fetches and displays real-time environmental statistics using the OpenWeatherMap API.
It features a dashboard showing air quality(present option).
temperature, and other environmental data for a specific city, like Bangalore, through latitude and longitude (will be integrated soon).

Technologies Used:
1. React for frontend
2. HTML for structure
3. CSS for styling
4. OpenWeatherMap API for fetching weather and air quality data
5. JavaScript for functionality and integration

Prerequisites:
Node.js (version 14 or higher)
npm (Node Package Manager) comes with Node.js
VS Code or any code editor of your choice
OpenWeatherMap API Key (Sign up on the OpenWeatherMap website to get your API key)

Setting Up the Project:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the project folder in VS Code.
Install dependencies by running npm install in the terminal.
Obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap and update it in the project.

How to Run the Project Locally:
After setting up, run the application using the command npm start.
Open the browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the app.


Current Status:
This project is still under development. While the core features are in place, I am working on adding more data sources, improving the UI, and ensuring a smooth user experience.


Deploying the Project:
Once the project is running locally, you can deploy it to a platform such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel for live access.

Troubleshooting:
Ensure the OpenWeatherMap API key is correctly configured in the JavaScript files.
If dependencies are missing, run npm install again to ensure all packages are installed.
If the API data isn't showing, check for any errors in the browserâ€™s developer console.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single-build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
